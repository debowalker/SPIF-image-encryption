# SPIF

  `SPIF` is picture encryption technique developed by Elijah Hopp (A.K.A Mr.Zeus), it currently is only avalible as a Python module, but soon(Pre0.2) a CLI will be included.

<h2>How it works</h2>

  `SPIF` takes each pixel of an input file (A picture) converts it into the closest 8-bit color (Only thanks to Pablox-cl), then `SPIF` takes an `end_table`(`Encryption aNd Decryption TABLE`) and converts each pixel into a charater, writing the charater to an output file. Sadly each picture is reduced down to 8-bit color, this causes `SPIF` image-encryption to be only sutible for situations where security is the key (Pun very much intended). :D

# "SPIF"?

The name "SPIF" is an ode to the Calvin's imaginary charater [Spaceman Spiff][0], from  [Bill Watterson's][1] [Calvin And Hobbes][2].
